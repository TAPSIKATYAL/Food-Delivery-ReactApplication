# Portfolio Project

## Overview

This project showcases my skills in frontend development using **React.js** and other modern web technologies. It highlights core features like state management, API integration, routing, and responsive design. The project is continually evolving, with planned features such as Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Jest for testing.

## Features Covered

- âœ… **React Project Setup from Scratch**: The project was built from the ground up using modern React.js best practices, including the latest tools like Webpack, Babel, and Parcel for bundling.
  
- âœ… **Deep Dive into JSX and Other Core React Features**: It leverages JSX syntax to create reusable, modular components with Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm.

- âœ… **Exploring the React Routing World**: React Router is used to handle dynamic page navigation, including private and public routes.

- âœ… **Playing with Live API Data, and Handling It Effectively**: The app integrates with a live API to fetch, display, and manipulate data in real-time. Axios is used for making API requests, and the app gracefully handles loading and error states.

- âœ… **Functional vs Class-Based Components**: The project demonstrates the difference between functional and class-based components, showcasing how functional components with hooks can replace older class-based components.

## Planned Features

- ðŸš§ **Redux for State Management**: Redux and Redux Toolkit will be implemented to manage global state efficiently, allowing the application to scale better.
  
- ðŸš§ **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: The app will be styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure consistent and responsive design with a utility-first approach.

- ðŸš§ **Testing with Jest**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests will be written using Jest to ensure code quality and stability across key components.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router**: Dynamic routing for React applications
